Assignment 7

1. It means that once a list is created it can be changed while the program is running.
2. c = a + b
3. y = x[2:4]
4. listLength = len(x)
5. y = reverse(x)
6. remove(item) removes the first occurrence of item in the list. Del removes the item at the index specified.
7. 
    try:
        index = x.index(3)
        print "Yes"
    except ValueError:
        print "No"
8. 
    min = min(x)
    max = max(x)
    total = 0
    for value in x:
        total += value
    avg = value / len(x)
9. The main difference is that tuples are immutable or they cannot be changed once created.
10. u = list(t)
